Software Engineering group project.  The assignment is to write a library system using the principles that we have learned.

Mission Statement

Our mission is to create a usable library software that will maintain a
current list of their books and their state of availability as well as a list of
library members and the books they are borrowing.  The software is finished when
both parties agree that it is useful for managing such a library.
