= Spec =

This simulates a library.

Patrons may check books out and check them in.

 
{{{
1. The books are contained in a file. The program reads the file at the beginning of the program (allow the user to select the file name), and writes it out at the end of the program.
     1. The format of the file is up to the designers, but it must contain the book information as well as the status (is it checked out, if so, by whom)
     2. If you have time, you may add a feature to add or remove books.
2. The books are of the following types (with their loan times):
     1. Adult (2 weeks)
     2. Children’s (1 week)
     3. Media
           1. DVDs (2 days)
           2. Videotapes (3 days)
3. There are two types of patrons: Adults and Children. Children may only check out children’s books.
     1. The list of patrons is contained in a file that is read in.
           1. If you have time, you may add a feature to add or remove patrons.
     2. Adults may have up to 6 books checked out at a time.
     3. Children may have up to 3 books checked out at a time.
4. Check out, Check in
     1. Adults and children may check books out and check them back in. If you are using a GUI, you can use various drop down lists to select the patron and the book. If you are using a CLI, you might want to display a numbered list of patrons, let the person select a number, for the patron, and then do something similar for the book to check out.
     2. Checked out books may not be checked out (duh!)
     3. Check in/out one book at a time. If you have time, you may add multiple checkout capabilities.
5. Lists
     1. All books and their status
     2. Overdue books
     3. A Patron’s books that are checked out
6. Date: Since we are simulating time, allow the date to be advanced. You will probably want to build a little date class for this (and for the due dates)
     1. Pick some date to start with.
     2. Allow the user to advance the date, one day at a time
7. Interface: Either GUI or CLI. If it is a CLI, you will want a little menu with the possible functions. To review, these are the basic functions:
     1. Check out a book
     2. Check in a book
     3. List all books
     4. List overdue books
     5. List a patron’s books
     6. Advance the date
     7. Quit
