# Mission Statement #

Our mission is to create a usable library software that will maintain a
current list of their books and their state of availability as well as a list of
library members and the books they are borrowing.  The software is finished when
both parties agree that it is useful for managing such a library.




# Priorities #

  * Release Date

Retain if possible:
  * Functionality
